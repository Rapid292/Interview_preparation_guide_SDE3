# Common mistakes:
# 1. Not handling the case when the input string length is less than 2
# 2. Incorrectly calculating the start indices for odd and even length palindromes
# 3. Forgetting to update both start and max_len when a longer palindrome is found

# Notes:
# Time Complexity: O(n^2)
# - We iterate through the string once, and for each character,
#   we potentially check two substrings of length up to n
# Space Complexity: O(1)
# - We use only a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size

# Approach:
# 1. Handle edge cases (strings of length 0 or 1)
# 2. Iterate through the string, considering each character as a potential center
# 3. For each center, check both odd and even length palindromes
# 4. Keep track of the start index and length of the longest palindrome found
# 5. Return the longest palindromic substring

class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Common mistakes:
        # 1. Not considering the case when the longest palindrome is in the middle of the string
        # 2. Not using a flag to check if the current substring is a palindrome

        # Notes:
        # Time Complexity: O(n^3)
        # Space Complexity: O(1)

        # Approach:
        # This solution uses two nested loops to generate all possible substrings of the given string.
        # For each substring, it checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.
        # If the substring is a palindrome, it checks if it is longer than the current maximum.

        def is_palindrome(s):
            # This function checks if a string is a palindrome.
            # It does this by comparing the string with its reverse.
