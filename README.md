## Tackling DS/Algo Questions

1. **Understand the Problem Statement**
   - **Clarify Requirements**: Carefully read the problem. Clarify ambiguities by asking questions to ensure a full understanding of inputs, outputs, edge cases, and constraints.
   - **Restate the Problem**: Summarize the problem to the interviewer in your own words to confirm your understanding.
   - **Identify Constraints**: Understand the time and space complexity constraints and ensure your solution will meet these requirements.

2. **Approach & High-Level Plan**
   - **Brute Force Solution**: First, explain a brute force approach, even if it's inefficient. This demonstrates that you know how to start tackling the problem.
   - **Optimal Approach**: After explaining brute force, move to an optimized approach. Discuss potential data structures or algorithms that could make the solution more efficient (e.g., binary search, dynamic programming, etc.).
   - **Talk Out Loud**: Share your thought process with the interviewer. Highlight your considerations like edge cases, time/space complexity trade-offs, and whether the problem can be solved iteratively or recursively.

3. **Optimization and Complexity Analysis**
   - **Analyze Time & Space Complexity**: Calculate the complexity of your approach using Big O notation.
   - **Optimize**: If there’s room for improvement, explain how you could optimize the solution further by using better algorithms or more efficient data structures.

4. **Pseudocode**
   - **Draft Pseudocode**: Once you've discussed and optimized your solution, outline the logic in pseudocode.
   - **Structured Approach**: Focus on structuring your logic with clarity. Break it into small, manageable functions or steps, ensuring modularity.
   - **Edge Cases**: Mention edge cases you’ll handle in your pseudocode (e.g., empty inputs, duplicates, large datasets, etc.).

5. **Implementation**
   - **Write Clean Code**: Implement the solution in Python with readable and maintainable code. Follow Pythonic principles, and make sure you write clean, self-explanatory code.
     - **Use Classes & Functions**: If applicable, encapsulate your logic into classes or functions. Follow SOLID principles like single responsibility and open/closed principles.
     - **Use Design Patterns**: Apply design patterns where applicable. For instance, if you need to manage different algorithms, consider the Strategy pattern. If using recursion, ensure it’s clear and optimized (e.g., using memoization).
   - **Code Modularity**: Break down your solution into clear methods/functions. Each method should do one thing well.
   - **Exception Handling**: Add meaningful error and exception handling to ensure robustness.

6. **Test Your Solution**
   - **Test Cases**: Start with basic test cases and then handle edge cases. Mention how you would test for performance, such as handling large input sizes.
   - **Dry Run**: Walk through the code with an example to demonstrate its correctness and efficiency.

7. **Reflection & Further Optimization**
   - **Discuss Limitations**: Reflect on your solution, stating where it could be improved or scaled further.
   - **Iterate if Needed**: If time allows, consider further improvements or refactor sections to make them cleaner or more efficient.

### By following this structured process, you’ll demonstrate problem-solving ability, code optimization skills, and a solid understanding of software engineering principles, which are crucial at the SDE 3 level.
