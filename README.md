## Tackling DS/Algo Questions

1. **Understand the Problem Statement**
   - **Clarify Requirements**: Carefully read the problem. Clarify ambiguities by asking questions to ensure a full understanding of inputs, outputs, edge cases, and constraints.
   - **Restate the Problem**: Summarize the problem to the interviewer in your own words to confirm your understanding.
   - **Identify Constraints**: Understand the time and space complexity constraints and ensure your solution will meet these requirements.

2. **Approach & High-Level Plan**
   - **Brute Force Solution**: First, explain a brute force approach, even if it's inefficient. This demonstrates that you know how to start tackling the problem.
   - **Optimal Approach**: After explaining brute force, move to an optimized approach. Discuss potential data structures or algorithms that could make the solution more efficient (e.g., binary search, dynamic programming, etc.).
   - **Talk Out Loud**: Share your thought process with the interviewer. Highlight your considerations like edge cases, time/space complexity trade-offs, and whether the problem can be solved iteratively or recursively.

3. **Optimization and Complexity Analysis**
   - **Analyze Time & Space Complexity**: Calculate the complexity of your approach using Big O notation.
   - **Optimize**: If there‚Äôs room for improvement, explain how you could optimize the solution further by using better algorithms or more efficient data structures.

4. **Pseudocode**
   - **Draft Pseudocode**: Once you've discussed and optimized your solution, outline the logic in pseudocode.
   - **Structured Approach**: Focus on structuring your logic with clarity. Break it into small, manageable functions or steps, ensuring modularity.
   - **Edge Cases**: Mention edge cases you‚Äôll handle in your pseudocode (e.g., empty inputs, duplicates, large datasets, etc.).

5. **Implementation**
   - **Write Clean Code**: Implement the solution in Python with readable and maintainable code. Follow Pythonic principles, and make sure you write clean, self-explanatory code.
     - **Use Classes & Functions**: If applicable, encapsulate your logic into classes or functions. Follow SOLID principles like single responsibility and open/closed principles.
     - **Use Design Patterns**: Apply design patterns where applicable. For instance, if you need to manage different algorithms, consider the Strategy pattern. If using recursion, ensure it‚Äôs clear and optimized (e.g., using memoization).
   - **Code Modularity**: Break down your solution into clear methods/functions. Each method should do one thing well.
   - **Exception Handling**: Add meaningful error and exception handling to ensure robustness.

6. **Test Your Solution**
   - **Test Cases**: Start with basic test cases and then handle edge cases. Mention how you would test for performance, such as handling large input sizes.
   - **Dry Run**: Walk through the code with an example to demonstrate its correctness and efficiency.

7. **Reflection & Further Optimization**
   - **Discuss Limitations**: Reflect on your solution, stating where it could be improved or scaled further.
   - **Iterate if Needed**: If time allows, consider further improvements or refactor sections to make them cleaner or more efficient.

### By following this structured process, you‚Äôll demonstrate problem-solving ability, code optimization skills, and a solid understanding of software engineering principles, which are crucial at the SDE 3 level.

### OOPs Concepts:
![OOPs Concepts](oops_concepts.png)

1. **Abstraction**
   - Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary parts to the user.
2. **Encapsulation**
   - Binding the data (attributes) and code (methods) that operates on the data into a single unit.
3. **Inheritance**
   - Inheritance is a mechanism where a class acquires the properties and behaviors of another class.
4. **Polymorphism**
   - Polymorphism allows you to define a single interface or method in a base class and have multiple derived classes implement or override that method.

### SOLID Principles:
![SOLID Principles](solid_principles.png)

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - A class should have only one responsibility.
2. **Open/Closed Principle**
   - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**
   - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle**
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
   - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

### Design Patterns:
![Common Design Patterns](common_design_patterns.png)
https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns

#### Creational Patterns
Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory**: Defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.
- **Object Pool**: Manages a pool of reusable objects, optimizing the performance by reusing objects rather than creating and destroying them frequently.

#### Structural Patterns
Structural patterns deal with object composition or the structure of classes and objects, ensuring that if one part changes, the entire structure can still function properly.

- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together, converting one interface into another that a client expects.
- **Bridge**: Separates an object‚Äôs abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- **Decorator**: Adds additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.
- **Flyweight**: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects by sharing as much data as possible.
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

#### Behavioral Patterns
Behavioral patterns deal with communication between objects, outlining patterns of how objects interact and distribute responsibility.

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers, allowing multiple objects an opportunity to handle the request without coupling the sender with the receiver.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **Interpreter**: Defines a grammar for a language and interprets sentences in the language.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Mediator**: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.
- **Memento**: Captures and restores an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.
- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
- **Visitor**: Represents an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure, allowing one to define new operations without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
