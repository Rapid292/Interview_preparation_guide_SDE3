#### list(strs) is not the same as [strs]

strs = ["hello"]

# Incorrect return type using list(strs)
# This will produce a list of characters of the single string element.
result = list(strs)
print(result)  # ['hello']  => Wrong for this context

# Correct return type using [strs]
# This will embed the single string in a new list, as intended.
result = [strs]
print(result)  # [['hello']]  => Correct for this context
