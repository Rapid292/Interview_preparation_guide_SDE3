# Check using `if complement in num_map:`:
# - Time Complexity: O(1) (constant time) due to dictionary hash lookup.
# - This is more readable and directly checks for the presence of the key.
# - Preferred unless you need to handle specific cases where the value might be None.

# Check using `if num_map.get(complement) != None:`:
# - Time Complexity: O(1), also uses hash lookup.
# - `.get()` allows a default return value (None), but if `None` is stored as a value, this check might give incorrect results.
# - Use `if num_map.get(complement) is not None:` to handle cases where None could be a stored value.

# Recommendation: Use `if complement in num_map:` for better readability unless handling None values is required.
